# NFT Market

A Web3 NFT marketplace with minting for pictures. An end-to-end build.

Based on a tutorial by [Nader Dabit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKJBEEXUha0)

Verified on Polygon Mumbai testnet

Tech used:

- Ganache
- Polygon
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- ethers.js
- IPFS
- React
- Next.js
- tailwind.css

Some changes I made:

- version 17 of node.js didn't work, used 16.13.2
- Used Web3.Storage for IPFS instead of Infura
- Used Alchemy instead of Infura
- added some comments

As always, huge thanks to all the giants upon whose shoulders I've built my works!
